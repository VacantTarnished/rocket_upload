# Rocket Upload
## What is this
This is a basic API File Upload using **Rust** and the Cargo **Rocket**.  
  
If you want to use this, I highly recommend checking out the configuration documentation from Rocket found [here](https://rocket.rs/v0.5-rc/guide/configuration/)  
  
Also if you want to use Docker Compose for this there is a example compose file [here](docker-compose.yml)

## How to build the Binary
1. Clone the Repository (duh)
2. Have cargo (if not install it [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install))
3. Open a terminal and switch to the root of this repository
4. Execute this command: ```cargo build --release```
5. The Binary is now available in target/release
